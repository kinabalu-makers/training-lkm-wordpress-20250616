        <h1>What is Containerization?</h1>
        <p>
            Containerization is a technology that packages an application and its dependencies into a single, lightweight unit called a container. Containers ensure that applications run consistently across different computing environments by isolating them from the underlying system.
        </p>
        <h2>How Does Containerization Work?</h2>
        <p>
            Containers use operating system-level virtualization to run multiple isolated applications on a single host. Each container includes the application code, libraries, and configuration files needed to run, but shares the host system's kernel.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Containers run independently, preventing conflicts between applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Containers can be deployed on any system that supports container runtimes, such as Docker.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Containers are lightweight and start quickly, using fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Popular containerization platforms include Docker and Kubernetes, which help manage and orchestrate containers at scale.
